# solana-switchboard-vrf-pool

Example Solana program using Switchboard's VRF and a VrfAccount pool schema

# What does this do?

This is a Solana program that allows users to request randomness using [Switchboard](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/switchboard-v2)'s VRF, in a "multi-threaded" way, using resources more efficiently.

# What's that about resources?

VRF requests need a VrfAccount to be available. Think of this as a store where you queue amongst other people to finally get to the cashier or something.

In the same way cashiers take a salary, VrfAccounts have a cost to be created. Users can either have:

- Their own "cashier" (one VrfAccount per user) which will always be free since only they can use it
   - **Most expensive and inefficient schema, you pay too many cashiers and they are almost always doing nothing**
- Only one "cashier" (one VrfAccount altogether) which will be mostly always used
   - **Cheapest schema, bad user experience, queue is always too long**
- A few "cashiers" (several VrfAccounts at disposal, pool) which gives a max cap of N users that the program can handle simultaneously
   - **Best use of resources**

# How it's done

This program has the following instructions:

- `initialize()` - Admin initializes the program with basic global state and empty VrfAccount pool
- `enlarge_pool()` - Admin can add VrfAccounts to the pool
- `create_dice()` - User can create a dice (PDA with one field `face: u8`). Randomness is requested here
- `settle_dice()` - Unpermissioned function set as callback; Switchboard calls here when the randomness is ready
- `claim_dice()` - User can claim a dice that has been rolled (just logs the rolled value)

An SDK is provided to easily interact with this program, in which an admin can just call `sdk.enlargePool(size)` to increase the pool's size if they find the size is too small for the number of users.

# Testing

Install the dependencies:

```
yarn add \
        @switchboard-xyz/sbv2-utils \
        @switchboard-xyz/switchboard-v2 \
        @solana/web3.js \
        @project-serum/anchor@^0.25.0 \
        @project-serum/borsh \
        bn.js
yarn add -D \
        @switchboard-xyz/cli@^2 \
        anchor-client-gen \
        @types/bn.js
```

Create Switchboard local test environment:

```
sbv2 solana localnet env --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json --outputDir .switchboard
echo ".switchboard" >> .gitignore
```

Now, according to Switchboard you can run this using only one command, but it doesn't work for me. So just open two more terminals and run these commands:

```
# Shell 1
.switchboard/start-local-validator.sh

# Shell 2
.switchboard/start-oracle.sh

# Shell 3
anchor build; anchor deploy; anchor run test
```
